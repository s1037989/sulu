Kal,

Great product you made here!  I NEVER would have thought that an Uproar
product would exist for Linux!  The software provided by Sprint is the
worst software I have ever seen.  Simply fantastic!

I just thought I would give you some feedback, specifically on the
Makefile.  I had to modify the INCLUDES and the LDFLAGS as below in order
for the usb.h include file and libusb.so library files to be picked up by
gcc.

Now here's where my REAL trouble came in!  When I initially ran 'make'
as specified by the README and after I made the INCLUDES/LDFLAGS
modifications, sulu compiled just fine.  When I went to execute the
progam, it would always give a segmentation fault.  When stepping thru
the script I found it to dump when probing the devices in the
Uproar_Initialize routine.  It took about 3 hours to find the solution 
to this tiny problem.  I had to step thru the source code and trim out
all GTK code as well as read up on the libusb code.  I then found that I
needed the following gcc parameters: -Wl,--rpath -Wl,${LIBUSB}/lib
Once I did that there was no more dumpage and the program worked
perfectly!  I couldn't find any libusb documentation; do you perhaps know
what rpath is and why it's required to run the program but not compile it?

Anyway, just thought you might like to document that in your package and
save the next person some possible trouble.

If you'd like any version numbers from me for a better bug report, let me
know.

LIBUSB      = /opt/libusb
INCLUDES    = `${LIBUSB}/bin/libusb-config --cflags` `gtk-config --cflags`
LDFLAGS     = `${LIBUSB}/bin/libusb-config --libs`
LIBRARIES   = -Wl,--rpath -Wl,${LIBUSB}/lib `gtk-config --libs`

Thanks again!

Samsung Uproar Linux Utility (sulu)

Sulu is a graphical utility for transferring mp3's between
your Samsung Uproar and your Linux computer.  It uses the 
GTK+ toolkit for the user interface and libusb.  Sulu is
licensed under the GPL (see the file COPYING).

You will need a kernel with USB support properly configured.  
I used a stock RedHat 7.2 install.  You can check whether USB 
is properly configured for your hardware by entering:

grep Vendor /proc/bus/usb/devices

You should see a line with "Vendor=04e8 ProdID=6600".

Once USB is properly setup you will have to install the 
shared library and the devel libraries for libusb.
(http://libusb.sourceforge.net/download.html).

To compile sulu, just type "make".  The executable is named sulu.
You need to run as root.
